description: Exposing how the khawārij conflate tashrīʿ lughawī (legislative enactment) with tashrīʿ istilāḥī (adding to the religion) to manufacture takfīr — with evidence from al-Ṭabarī, the Ṣaḥābah, and Qāsim ibn Sallām.
---

Now that we've addressed the previous shubhah, we turn to the concept of *Tashrīʿ* (تشريع — legislation) and how the Salaf understood and employed this word — because the khawārij have built an entire structure of takfīr upon a deliberate confusion between two distinct meanings.

## Tashrīʿ Has Two Entirely Different Meanings

The word tashrīʿ means: to legislate. But it divides into two categories that must never be conflated:

<div class="principle-box">
  <div class="p-label">Category One — Tashrīʿ Istilāḥī (Technical/Religious Sense)</div>
  <div class="p-text">Adding legislation <em>into the religion</em> — attributing to Allāh what He did not legislate. This is what Allāh condemned in the Qurʾān and what the Ṣaḥābah called it: a lie against Allāh. It is kufr akbar by ijmāʿ.</div>
</div>

<div class="principle-box">
  <div class="p-label">Category Two — Tashrīʿ Lughawī (Linguistic/Worldly Sense)</div>
  <div class="p-text">Enacting a system of man-made laws and binding it upon people — not attributed to the religion of Allāh. This is no different in nature from other forms of al-ḥukm bi ghayr mā ʾanzal Allāh, and carries no additional weight that would elevate it to kufr akbar.</div>
</div>

The khawārij deliberately collapse these two definitions into one — and then apply the ruling of the first upon situations that only meet the second. This is where their corruption begins.

## The Qurʾānic Usage — Tashrīʿ in the Religion

<div class="verse-block">
  <div class="v-arabic">أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَنۢ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ</div>
  <div class="v-translation">"Or do they have partners who have legislated for them in the religion that which Allāh has not permitted?"</div>
  <div class="v-ref">Sūrat al-Shūrā, 42:21</div>
</div>

This is the verse the khawārij cite as their evidence. But notice the two conditions combined in it — which Bandar al-Miḥyānī clarifies precisely:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Bandar al-Miḥyānī — Kitāb al-Ḥukm bi Ghayr Mā ʾAnzal Allāh, p. 129</div>
  <div class="qt">"The verse only indicates the disbelief of the one who substitutes (al-mubaddil); because it has declared disbelief for whoever combines two descriptions: (1) Legislation — 'they legislated for them'; and (2) Attribution to the religion — 'from the religion.' And this is what is called al-tabdīl, and it has already been stated that it is disbelief by consensus."</div>
</div>

Two conditions must be present simultaneously: legislation, *and* attribution of that legislation to the religion of Allāh. Remove the second condition and you no longer have tashrīʿ istilāḥī — you have something else entirely.

## Imām al-Ṭabarī Confirms the Meaning

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Imām al-Ṭabarī — Tafsīr, vol. 9, p. 851</div>
  <div class="qt">"Allāh, the Exalted, says about these polytheists: 'They have legislated for them a religion other than that which Allāh has permitted.' He means: They innovated for them in the religion what Allāh did not allow them to innovate."</div>
</div>

The key phrase is **«ابتدعوا لهم من الدين»** — "they innovated for them *in the religion*." Al-Ṭabarī's own commentary confirms that what is condemned is innovation into the dīn itself — not worldly law-making in isolation.

Thus: **Tashrīʿ istilāḥī = Tabdīl**. They are the same thing — and both are kufr akbar by ijmāʿ. But tashrīʿ lughawī is a separate matter entirely.

## How the Greatest of the Salaf Used This Word

The understanding becomes undeniable when we examine how the Ṣaḥābah themselves used the word tashrīʿ — from ʿUmar and ʿAlī (رضي الله عنهما) directly:

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">ʿAṭāʾ ibn al-Sāʾib → Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān → ʿAlī (رضي الله عنه) — via al-Qāḍī Abū al-Faḍl al-Qushayrī al-Baṣrī (d. 344 AH), Aḥkām al-Qurʾān, vol. 1, pp. 486–487</div>
  <div class="matn">Some people in Shām drank wine under Yazīd ibn Abī Sufyān and declared it ḥalāl, citing the verse of al-Māʾidah: 93. ʿAlī wrote to ʿUmar (رضي الله عنهما) about them, who consulted the people. They said: "They have lied upon Allāh and <strong>legislated in His religion that which He did not permit.</strong>" ʿAlī then said: "If they do not repent, then strike their necks — for they have lied upon Allāh and legislated in His religion what Allāh did not permit."</div>
</div>

This is the istilāḥī meaning in action: those men claimed wine was ḥalāl — they attributed a ruling *to the religion of Allāh*. That is why ʿAlī and ʿUmar used the word tashrīʿ and issued the ruling they did. The condition of attribution to the dīn was present.

## Tashrīʿ Lughawī: What the Salaf Actually Said

Now what about man-made laws enacted without attribution to the religion? Qāsim ibn Sallām (رحمه الله) addresses this directly:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Qāsim ibn Sallām — Kitāb al-Īmān, p. 86</div>
  <div class="qt">"Not all of these reports mean that the one who commits them is an ignorant disbeliever, but that they are sins; and the one who commits them may be ignorant, not disbeliever or hypocrite, while being a believer in Allāh and His revelation, and fulfilling His obligations. Rather, it means that these actions are shown to be prohibited and forbidden by the Book and the Sunnah as those done by the disbelievers — so that Muslims avoid them and do not resemble their morals or their laws (sharāʾiʿ)."</div>
</div>

Qāsim ibn Sallām explicitly affirms: a Muslim who falls into these things — including the use of the laws of the kuffār — remains a believer and is not declared a kāfir.

## The Maks: A Jāhiliyyah Law Enacted by Muslim Rulers

The strongest proof comes from history itself. The *maks* was a tax taken from merchants — a practice originating in the Jāhiliyyah, enacted by the pagan Arab and non-Arab kings before Islam. The Prophet ﷺ abrogated it. Yet Muslim rulers after him reinstated it — and none of the Salaf declared takfīr upon them for it.

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Lisān al-ʿArab, vol. 6, p. 220</div>
  <div class="qt">"Al-maks: money that used to be taken from merchants selling goods in the markets during the Jāhiliyyah."</div>
</div>

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Qāsim ibn Sallām — Kitāb al-Amwāl, p. 634</div>
  <div class="qt">"The strictness concerning it: that it had its origin in the Jāhiliyyah, practiced by the kings of the Arabs and the non-Arabs alike... And we know from this that it was a custom of the Jāhiliyyah, with many reports about it, but Allāh abrogated that through His Messenger ﷺ."</div>
</div>

ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz (رحمه الله) had to write to his governors specifically ordering the abolition of the maks — which means it had been practiced by rulers before him throughout his era. Qāsim ibn Sallām lived through and after this period, documented it, yet never declared those rulers disbelievers for enacting pagan legislation upon the people.

Ibn al-Qayyim (رحمه الله) likewise mentions this in *Aḥkām Ahl al-Dhimmah*, vol. 1, pages 213–214 — further confirming that the scholars viewed this as a major sin, not as kufr akbar.

## Why Tashrīʿ Lughawī Cannot Be Kufr Akbar on Its Own

The khawārij argue: "General legislation is worse than a single ruling because it repeats the sin indefinitely and makes it the norm." This argument collapses under scrutiny:

<div class="principle-box">
  <div class="p-label">The Khawārij's Argument Exposed</div>
  <div class="p-text">Making takfīr for the <em>persistence</em> or <em>repetition</em> of a major sin — without the conditions that elevate it to kufr — is itself one of the defining characteristics of the Khawārij. The frequency of a sin does not change its category.</div>
</div>

The difference between tashrīʿ lughawī and a single instance of ḥukm bi ghayr mā ʾanzal Allāh is only in frequency and establishment — not in fundamental nature. If a scholar would not declare a judge who issued a single unjust ruling a kāfir, then the same ruling applied a hundred times does not become kufr akbar merely by repetition, absent the conditions of tabdīl or attribution to the religion.

<div class="conclusion">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Tashrīʿ in the Qurʾān and in the usage of the Ṣaḥābah refers specifically to adding legislation <em>into the religion of Allāh</em> — which is tabdīl by another name, and is kufr akbar by ijmāʿ. This requires two conditions: legislation, <em>and</em> attribution to the dīn.</p>
  <p>Tashrīʿ lughawī — enacting man-made law without attributing it to Allāh's religion — falls under the general category of al-ḥukm bi ghayr mā ʾanzal Allāh: a major sin, potentially kufr aṣghar, but not kufr akbar absent additional conditions. The Salaf themselves, including Qāsim ibn Sallām, witnessed this and never declared the rulers disbelievers for it.</p>
  <p>Whoever uses the word tashrīʿ in its linguistic sense and then applies the ruling of the technical sense is either ignorant of this distinction or is deliberately exploiting it. Either way, their takfīr is invalid.</p>
