Hammād Ibn Zayd said: “The people of a man’s city know him best.”

This is a foundational principle with the People of Ḥadeeth.

  <div class="quote-text">
    “A man would come to us from different cities, and he would be mentioned (with good), so we would narrate from him and speak well of him. But when we asked the people of his own city (regarding him) we would find that he was NOT as we had said (in praise of him).”

He also said: **“The people of a man’s city know him best.”**

Al-Khaṭīb (رحمه الله) commented on this:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">Al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī (رحمه الله)</div>
  <div class="quote-text">
    “Due to the fact that they (the people from his city) possessed additional knowledge about his true state – beyond what the outsider knew merely from his outward display of uprightness. Hammād based his judgment upon what the people of the man’s own city knew concerning his flaws, rather than (relying) on the outsider’s testimony of his apparent integrity.”

## Historical Examples of this Principle

### Imām Mālik and 'Abd al-Karīm b. Abī al-Khāriq
Imām Mālik narrated from ‘Abd al-Karīm b. Abī al-Khāriq in his Muwaṭṭa, not knowing his true reality. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr mentions regarding ‘Abd al-Karīm: He was a teacher, and had a dignified appearance, which led Mālik to be misled by his outward demeanor. However, since he was not from Mālik’s land, Mālik was unaware of his true status. (Al-Tamhīd 20/65)

### Ibn ‘Atī on Shaqīq al-Dhabī
Ibn ‘Atī said about Shaqīq al-Dhabī: Shaqīq al-Dhabī is a Kufan, and I only know him as such. He was one of the storytellers of the people of Kufa, and storytelling was plentiful in his speech. I do not know of any aḥādīth attributed to him with a proper chain of narration as is with others. He is condemned by the people of his land, and they know him best. (al-Kāmil 5/71)
