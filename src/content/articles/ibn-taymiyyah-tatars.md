  </div>
</div>

**The Sunnī replied:** I ask you to first establish three premises for this objection to be valid:

1.  **First premise:** Prove that Ibn Taymiyyah, the well-known mujtahid, was a legal authority whose actions can serve as evidence.
2.  **Second premise:** Prove that the Tatars were Muslims, because our discussion is entirely about Muslim rulers.
3.  **Third premise:** Prove that they were rulers over the Muslims in the Levant.

If these three premises are established, then your claim that Ibn Taymiyyah rebelled against his rulers and that following him was correct might hold.

## Response to the First Premise

It does not require elaboration to refute it, because no one claims that Ibn Taymiyyah is a legal authority in himself. I do believe that no one among later generations matched him in knowledge, but it is not permissible to take the actions of anyone after the Prophets (peace be upon them) as evidence. The actions of the companions are a separate matter, which we are not discussing here.

## Response to the Second Premise: Were the Tatars Muslim?

The Tatars were not of the Islamic faith. Understanding their conditions is a principle upon which rulings are based. Ibn Taymiyyah stated in *Majmūʿ al-Fatāwā* (28/519–521):

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">Majmūʿ al-Fatāwā (28/519–521)</div>
  <div class="matn">
    "As for knowing the conditions of people, their belief in Jenghiz Khan was extreme. They believed he was the ‘Son of God’ in a manner similar to what the Christians believe regarding Jesus... Yet they consider him the greatest of messengers in their estimation, crediting him for what he established and legislated according to their desires.
    <br><br>
    They attribute their wealth to Jenghiz Khan, thank him for their food and drink, and permit killing anyone who opposes his commands. So how could they, outwardly appearing Muslim, equate Muḥammad ﷺ with Jenghiz Khan? They exaggerated the power of Jenghiz Khan over Muslims following the Quranic law and did not fight those followers as they fought the Muslims — indeed, even more severely."
  </div>
</div>

Ibn Taymiyyah and the Muslims fought the Tatars who were invading their lands. Allāh says:

<div class="verse-block">
  <div class="v-arabic">وَإِن طَآئِفَتَانِ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱقْتَتَلُوا۟ فَأَصْلِحُوا۟ بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ فَإِنۢ بَغَتْ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا عَلَى ٱلْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُوا۟ ٱلَّتِى تَبْغِى حَتَّىٰ تَفِيٓءَ إِلَىٰٓ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ</div>
  <div class="v-translation">"And if two groups of believers fight, make peace between them. But if one of them oppresses the other, fight the one that oppresses until it returns to Allāh’s command…"</div>
  <div class="v-ref">Sūrat al-Ḥujurāt 49:9</div>
</div>

This refers to fighting Muslims who aggress on other Muslim territories. How much more so for the Tatars, who came from disbelief and aggression?

## Response to the Third Premise: Did He Act Without Permission?

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">The Objection</div>
  <div class="quote-text">
    <strong>The Khārijī said:</strong> "But Ibn Taymiyyah fought the Tatars without the ruler’s permission."
  </div>
</div>

**The Sunnī replied:** This discussion is outside our topic, because it relates to the issue of jihād against disbelievers with the ruler’s permission, not rebellion.

Nevertheless, I say: **Yes! Ibn Taymiyyah fought the Tatars under the banner of the ruler of his time.** In *Majmūʿ Fatāwā* (28/463) he said:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah</div>
  <div class="quote-text">
    "When I entered Egypt at ʿAqīb al-ʿAskar and met with the sultan and the Muslim emirs, Allāh instilled in their hearts concern for jihād as He willed. When Allāh strengthened the hearts of the Muslims, the enemy was driven back..."
  </div>
</div>

His student, Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī [d.774AH], in *al-ʿUqūd al-Durrīyah* (p. 191), described the battle of Shaqhab, stating:

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī — al-ʿUqūd al-Durrīyah, p. 191</div>
  <div class="matn">
    "Allāh brought the Egyptian army under Amir al-Muʾminīn and al-Malik al-Nāṣir Muḥammad ibn Qalāwūn to confront the Tatars. The Sheikh met with the caliph, the sultan, and the senior emirs at Marj al-Ṣufr near Damascus... He prepared his forces to confront them in the mountains with the ruler, the vicegerent of the kingdom, and the victorious Syrian armies. He remained with the ruler during the siege and battles until Allāh opened the mountains and expelled their people."
  </div>
</div>

Ibn Taymiyyah traveled to leaders and the sultan, urging jihād, confronting emirs and armies with strong words. Thus, the Sheikh did not fight the Muslim ruler nor act without his permission, but fought with and under the ruler.

<div class="conclusion">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Ibn Taymiyyah did not fight the Muslim ruler, nor did he act without the ruler’s permission; he fought with him and under his command.</p>
