---

Let us move on to the authentication of the Athar of Ibn ʿAbbās (رضي الله عنه) with the wording *kufr dūna kufr* (كفر دون كفر)—which the khawārij attempt to weaken due to the disease and deviation they carry in their hearts.

## The Narration in al-Mustadrak

In *al-Mustadrak ʿalā al-Ṣaḥīḥayn* of al-Ḥākim al-Nīsābūrī (رحمه الله), he narrates the following athar with a full isnād:

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">Narrated by Aḥmad ibn Sulaymān al-Mawṣilī → ʿAlī ibn Ḥarb → Sufyān ibn ʿUyaynah → Hishām ibn Ḥujayr → Ṭāwūs → Ibn ʿAbbās (رضي الله عنهما)</div>
  <div class="matn">"It is not the disbelief that they go to. It is not disbelief that removes one from the religion. 'And whoever does not judge by what Allāh has revealed, then they are the disbelievers'—this is disbelief lesser than disbelief."</div>
  <div class="arabic">«لَيْسَ الْكُفْرَ الَّذِي يَذْهَبُونَ إِلَيْهِ، لَيْسَ كُفْرًا يَنْقُلُ عَنِ الْمِلَّةِ، كُفْرٌ دُونَ كُفْرٍ»</div>
  <div class="grading">
    <strong>Al-Ḥākim:</strong> "This narration has a sound chain and was not narrated by al-Bukhārī or Muslim." &nbsp;·&nbsp;
    <strong>Al-Dhahabī in Talkhīṣ:</strong> <span style="color:#a8d580">Ṣaḥīḥ ✓</span>
  </div>
</div>

## The Principle: Jarḥ Must Be Mufaṣṣar

Before examining the statements of the scholars regarding Hishām ibn Ḥujayr—the narrator through whom some attempt to weaken this athar—we must first establish the foundational principle in ḥadīth science that governs this entire discussion.

<div class="principle-box">
  <div class="principle-label">Qāʿidah · Foundational Principle</div>
  <div class="principle-text">In ḥadīth science, for criticism (Jarḥ) to take precedence over praise (Taʿdīl), it must be <em>mufaṣṣar</em>—detailed and substantiated with explicit reasoning.</div>
</div>

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">Ibn Kathīr · Ikhtiṣār ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth, pp. 193–194</div>
  <div class="quote-text">"When there is a contradiction between Jarḥ (criticism) and Taʿdīl (praise), the Jarḥ must be mufassar—whether it takes precedence, or the majority or the lesser view is preferred. This is a well-known dispute in the principles of fiqh, its branches, and ḥadīth science. The correct view is that Jarḥ is given absolute precedence if it is mufassar. And Allāh knows best."</div>
</div>

As Ibn Kathīr (رحمه الله) makes clear, mere unsubstantiated criticism is insufficient to override the praise of trustworthy scholars. This principle will prove decisive when we examine what was actually said about Hishām.

## The Scholars on Hishām ibn Ḥujayr al-Makkī

Let us now compile what the imams of ḥadīth criticism said about this narrator—drawing from both *Mīzān al-Iʿtidāl* of al-Dhahabī and *Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb* of Ibn Ḥajar.

      <div class="nc-val" style="font-style:italic; color: var(--green-deep)">
        <strong>وَاحْتَجَّ بِهِ الشَّيْخَيْنِ</strong> — Both al-Bukhārī and Muslim narrated from him in their Ṣaḥīḥ collections. The criticism is entirely vague and unsubstantiated (Jarḥ Mubham), not Mufaṣṣar.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Notice the pattern clearly: the praise from major imams—including the implicit acceptance by both al-Bukhārī and Muslim—is extensive, while the criticism amounts to no more than "weakened" or "did not approve him" without any reasoning whatsoever. This is precisely the Jarḥ Mubham (vague criticism) that scholars of ḥadīth do not consider sufficient to override established taʿdīl.

## The Position of al-Dhahabī via Ibrāhīm al-Ruḥaylī

Al-Dhahabī (رحمه الله) himself addressed Hishām in his book *Man Tukullima Fīhi wa-Huwa Muwaththaq* (About Whom It Has Been Spoken, and He Is Reliable), page 522. The muḥaqqiq Ibrāhīm al-Ruḥaylī, after surveying all statements, concluded:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">Muḥaqqiq Ibrāhīm al-Ruḥaylī — commentary on Man Tukullima Fīhi, p. 522</div>
  <div class="quote-text">"The reality is that he is not weak, and the criticism against him is ambiguous. The two Shaykhs (al-Bukhārī and Muslim) used him as evidence, but it appears from their work and the statements of the imams regarding him that there is some weakness; thus, his ḥadīth is classified as good (ḥasan). And Allāh knows best."</div>
</div>

## The Matter Is Settled: Corroboration Confirms Acceptance

Even if one were to take the most cautious position—following Sufyān ibn ʿUyaynah's statement that we accept from Hishām only what is corroborated by others—this does not harm our argument. Sufyān's position means: accept what Hishām narrated if it is supported elsewhere; reject only what he narrates uniquely.

The task, therefore, is to demonstrate that Hishām did *not* uniquely transmit this athar—that it is found through other chains as well, confirming it falls squarely within what Sufyān himself described as acceptable.

<div class="conclusion">
  <h3>Conclusion of This Section</h3>
  <p>The athar of Ibn ʿAbbās (رضي الله عنهما) stating <em>kufr dūna kufr</em> — that the verse in Sūrat al-Māʾidah refers to a lesser disbelief that does not expel one from the religion — is established at minimum as <strong>ḥasan</strong> (good). The criticism against its narrator Hishām ibn Ḥujayr is vague and non-specific (Jarḥ Mubham), while his praise from major imams is substantial, and both al-Bukhārī and Muslim narrated from him.</p>
  <p>The khawārij who attempt to weaponize technical criticism of Hishām to discard this athar are exposed as selectively wielding ḥadīth science as a tool for their theological agenda—not as sincere scholars seeking the truth. A ḥasan narration is a legal proof in Islamic scholarship, and this athar is further corroborated by supporting chains, as will be demonstrated.</p>
