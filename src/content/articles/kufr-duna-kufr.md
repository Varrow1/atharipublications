description: A detailed response to those who attempt to weaken the narration of Ibn ʿAbbās (رضي الله عنهما) regarding the ruling on governments — examining Hishām ibn Ḥujayr through the lens of Jarḥ wa-Taʿdīl.
---

Let us move on to the authentication of the Athar of Ibn ʿAbbās (رضي الله عنه) with the wording *kufr dūna kufr* (كفر دون كفر)—which the khawārij attempt to weaken due to the disease and deviation they carry in their hearts.

## The Narration in al-Mustadrak

In *al-Mustadrak ʿalā al-Ṣaḥīḥayn* of al-Ḥākim al-Nīsābūrī (رحمه الله), he narrates the following athar:

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">Narrated by Aḥmad ibn Sulaymān al-Mawṣilī → ʿAlī ibn Ḥarb → Sufyān ibn ʿUyaynah → Hishām ibn Ḥujayr → Ṭāwūs → Ibn ʿAbbās (رضي الله عنهما)</div>
  <div class="matn">"It is not the disbelief that they go to. It is not disbelief that removes one from the religion. 'And whoever does not judge by what Allāh has revealed, then they are the disbelievers'—this is disbelief lesser than disbelief."</div>
  <div class="arabic">«كُفْرٌ دُونَ كُفْرٍ»</div>
  <div class="grading"><strong>Al-Ḥākim:</strong> Sound chain, not in Bukhārī or Muslim. &nbsp;·&nbsp; <strong>Al-Dhahabī (Talkhīṣ):</strong> <span style="color:#a8d580">Ṣaḥīḥ ✓</span></div>
</div>

## The Principle: Jarḥ Must Be Mufaṣṣar

In ḥadīth science we have the concepts of Jarḥ wa-Taʿdīl—praise and criticism of narrators. For criticism to override praise, it must be detailed and explicit, known as *Jarḥ Mufaṣṣar*.

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Ibn Kathīr · Ikhtiṣār ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth, pp. 193–194</div>
  <div class="qt">"When there is a contradiction between Jarḥ and Taʿdīl, the Jarḥ must be mufassar. The correct view is that Jarḥ is given absolute precedence if it is mufassar. And Allāh knows best."</div>
</div>

<div class="principle-box">
  <div class="p-label">Qāʿidah · Foundational Principle</div>
  <div class="p-text">For criticism (Jarḥ) to take precedence over praise (Taʿdīl), it must be <em>mufaṣṣar</em> — detailed, explicit, and substantiated with reasoning. Vague criticism (Jarḥ Mubham) does not suffice.</div>

## Al-Dhahabī and Ibrāhīm al-Ruḥaylī's Final Word

Al-Dhahabī addressed Hishām in *Man Tukullima Fīhi wa-Huwa Muwaththaq*, page 522. The muḥaqqiq Ibrāhīm al-Ruḥaylī concluded:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Muḥaqqiq Ibrāhīm al-Ruḥaylī — Man Tukullima Fīhi, p. 522</div>
  <div class="qt">"The reality is that he is not weak, and the criticism against him is ambiguous. The two Shaykhs used him as evidence, but it appears there is some weakness; thus, his ḥadīth is classified as ḥasan (good). And Allāh knows best."</div>
</div>

<div class="conclusion">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The athar of Ibn ʿAbbās stating *kufr dūna kufr* is established at minimum as **ḥasan**. The criticism against Hishām is vague (Jarḥ Mubham) and insufficient to override extensive praise from major imams, including implicit acceptance by al-Bukhārī and Muslim.</p>
  <p>The khawārij who weaponize this technical criticism to discard the athar are exposed as selectively wielding ḥadīth science as a tool for their agenda—not as sincere scholars seeking the truth.</p>
