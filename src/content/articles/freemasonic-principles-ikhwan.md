description: "Exposing the Masonic and revolutionary origins of Ikhwani thought—from the 'golden principle' of Hassan al-Banna to the Leninist vanguard tactics of Sayyid Qutb."
---

The two methodological strains of Ikhwani thought—that of Hassan al-Banna (uniting everyone into a single mass irrespective of creed) and that of Sayyid Qutb (destructive revolutions against authorities in the name of social justice)—are taken from ideas and methods implemented by Freemasons in the 19th century to topple governments.

In this article, we present numerous statements from the scholars of the Sunnah: Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hādī, Shaykh ʿUbayd al-Jābirī, and Shaykh Ṣāliḥ al-Suḥaymī.

## Part 1: The Destructive Freemasonic Principle of Hassan al-Banna

The Shaykh said as occurs in his *Majmūʿ Kutub wa Rasāʾil* (14/205-206):

  <div class="quote-text">
    Now, they are leading us into unity of religions, starting out from the vile, destructive principle: <strong>"Let us cooperate in that which we agree and excuse each other in that which we disagree."</strong> This is an impure Freemasonic principle, devised by the Freemasons in order to gather together societies, nations, religions, and creeds under one Freemasonic flag.
    <br><br>
    This principle (as utilized by the Ikhwān) comes at the beginning of the affair calling that we should unite the Muslims, and they do not feel shy in including the Rāfiḍah, Bāṭiniyyah, and Ṣūfiyyah within it. Then when they have gained ground, they announce a call to the brotherhood of Christians, the unity of religions, and they set up conferences for it. These people have increased the Ummah in destruction.

### Analysis of the Origins

**ONE:** Freemasonry is an institution through which the destruction of national sovereignty is organized. The aim is a progressive merging of societies under one authority. The golden principle of al-Ikhwān came to Hassan al-Banna from Muhammad Abduh from Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (a Bāṭinī Freemason).

**TWO:** The two main strains of Ikhwani thought are founded upon the Freemasonic slogan: "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity." Although clothed in Islamic terms, their origins are clear. This clashes with the Divine Sharīʿah, which instead enjoins condemnation of deviance and patience upon the tyranny of rulers.

**THREE:** The "Fraternity" of the Ikhwān starts with innovators and ends with other religions. We see this in:
*   Sayyid Qutb's nearness with the Rāfiḍah (Ayatollah Kashani).
*   Hassan al-Banna's unification of the sects.
*   Yusuf al-Qaradawi's calls to the unity of creeds.

### The Leninist Influence on Sayyid Qutb

**FOUR:** The "Equality and Liberty" of the Ikhwān refers to freedom from authority brought about by revolutions. Shaykh Rabīʿ stated in *al-ʿAwāṣim* (p. 38):

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">Shaykh Rabīʿ — al-ʿAwāṣim, p. 38</div>
  <div class="quote-text">
    This tashrīʿ (legislation) that Sayyid Qutb ascribes to Islam—referring to aspects of socialism-Marxism—he borrowed them from Communist and Western principles which had become widespread in his lifetime. He mixed Marxist Socialism with the garment of Islam.
  </div>
</div>

Shaykh Rabīʿ also mentions that the manhaj of these people is derived from the Communists before it is derived from the Khawārij. As Daniel Martin and Lawrence Wright have observed, Qutb's *Milestones* resembles Lenin's *What Is to Be Done?*—advocating for a "vanguard" to lead a worldwide revolution.

## Part 2: Stratagems and Secret Plots

Shaykh Rabīʿ bin Hādī said in *Kashf al-Sitār* (p. 39):

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">Shaykh Rabīʿ — Kashf al-Sitār, p. 39</div>
  <div class="quote-text">
    If you wish to find the ideology of the Kharijites, you will find it; if you wish to find the ideology of the Muʿtazilah, you will find it; if you wish to find Secularism, you will find it; and if you wish to find Freemasonry, you will find it in their books and in their secret and open plots.
    <br><br>
    Read the books of al-Rāshid (Ahmad al-Ghāwī)... you will find them to be like, if they do not excel, the <strong>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</strong> in their vileness. These plans have been unleashed upon the lands of Tawḥīd and Sunnah.
  </div>
</div>

### The 21st Century Ikhwani Agenda

The Muslim Brotherhood operates via stealth, occupying strategic positions of influence. In the book *al-Ḥarakah al-Islāmiyyah, Ruʾyah Mustaqbaliyyah* (2012), theoreticians like Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Abdullah al-Nafeesee outline a new direction: making alliances with Liberals, Secularists, and Rāfiḍah to amass ground power that they previously lacked in the 1990s.

## Part 3: Statements of the Scholars

### Shaykh Ṣāliḥ al-Suḥaymī on Machiavellian Tactics

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="arabic">ثانياً: وضع النقاط على الحروف بتسمية أصحاب هذا الفكر بالأسماء اللائقة بهم فإنهم خوارج بل إنهم شر من الخوارج القدامى فإنهم ضموا إلى خارجيتهم وفكرهم المنحرف تطبيق نظرية ميكافيلي وهي أن الغاية تبرر الوسيلة.</div>
  <div class="matn">
    "Secondly, placing the dots on the letters by naming the people of this ideology with the names appropriate to them, for they are Khawārij—in fact, they are more evil than the Khawārij of old—because they added the application of Machiavellian philosophy: <strong>the ends justify the means</strong>."

### Shaykh Rabīʿ on Deceptive Slogans

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="arabic">والحركات الماسونية، كانت تحمل شعار العدالة، والمساواة، والحرية. والثورات الشيوعية كانت تحمل هذه الشعارات . وكلها خِدَع، وشعارات كاذبة، يفضح الله أصحابها.</div>
  <div class="matn">
    "The Freemasonic movements carried the slogan of 'justice,' 'equality,' and 'freedom.' The Communist revolutions also carried these slogans. All of them are deceptions and deceitful slogans; may Allāh expose those calling with them."

### Shaykh ʿUbayd al-Jābirī on Servants of Freemasonry

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="arabic">فأولئك الدعاة إن لم يكونوا ماسونيين فهم يخدمون الماسونية ، ويجادلون من أجلها</div>
  <div class="matn">
    "Those callers, if they are not Freemasons themselves, then they at least serve the agenda of the Freemasons and argue in favor of it."

</div>

<div class="conclusion">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The Ikhwān gather deviant sects under one umbrella using Freemasonic principles to wage war against the people of Tawḥīd. While they plot against the lands of the Sunnah, the lands of the Rāfiḍah and those where graves are worshipped are left alone. We seek refuge with Allāh from their evil.</p>
