description: Dismantling the most widely spread lies against the Imām — from the false claim about the Treaty of Ḥudaybiyyah, to the slander of Irjāʾ — with direct quotations from the Shaykh's own works.
---

We begin by addressing the most widely spread lie that has been said against him (رحمه الله) — the false claim that he said the Prophet ﷺ compromised on the fundamentals of the religion (*Tanāzul ʿan Uṣūl al-Dīn*) on the day of the Treaty of Ḥudaybiyyah. This is an outright fabrication and a baseless slander.

## First Lie: The Treaty of Ḥudaybiyyah Slander

From *Majmūʿ Rasāʾil wa Kutub* of Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hādī al-Madkhalī (رحمه الله), Volume 9, pages 134–135:

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">Majmūʿ Rasāʾil wa Kutub, Vol. 9, pp. 134–135</div>
  <div class="matn">"I say: The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ showed forbearance in this treaty regarding major matters — from both the fundamentals and the branches of the religion. Among the fundamentals in which he showed forbearance: not writing 'Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm,' and instead accepting what Suhayl ibn ʿAmr proposed: 'Bismik Allāhumma,' despite the anger of the Ṣaḥābah. And he showed forbearance in not writing 'Muḥammad Rasūl Allāh,' which is the second pillar of the two testimonies and a core of Islam, and instead accepting 'Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh.'"</div>
</div>

When ʿUmar (رضي الله عنه) addressed the Prophet ﷺ in his grief, saying:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (رضي الله عنه) — as narrated in the books of sīrah</div>
  <div class="qt">"Are you not truly the Prophet of Allāh?" — "Yes." — "Are we not upon the truth, and our enemy upon falsehood?" — "Yes." — "Then why do we give up and accept humiliation in our religion?"</div>
</div>

### The Shaykh's Own Clarification

The Shaykh himself addresses this in his footnote and on the following page (p. 136) with unmistakable clarity:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Shaykh Rabīʿ — Majmūʿ Rasāʾil, Vol. 9, p. 136</div>
  <div class="qt">"Reflect, O just reader, on this statement, which is a clear, explicit text stating the forbearance was in <em>not writing</em> 'Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm,' and <em>not writing</em> 'Muḥammad Rasūl Allāh.' This is a conscious differentiation between what was not written and what was being referred to in essence. This distinction is clear and manifest. No one casts doubt on this distinction except a wicked liar."</div>
</div>

<div class="principle-box">
  <div class="p-label">The Distinction Made Clear</div>
  <div class="p-text">The Shaykh stated that the Prophet ﷺ showed forbearance in the matter of <em>writing</em> these phrases — not that he compromised on the principles themselves. The Prophet ﷺ did not write "Muḥammad Rasūl Allāh" but he remained the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ in reality.</div>
</div>

The Shaykh's own words confirm he was speaking about the act of writing, not about the fundamentals themselves. And he (رحمه الله) responded to those who distorted his words in his *Sharḥ of Kitāb ʿAqīdat al-Ṣalaf*, pages 175–176:

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">Sharḥ Kitāb ʿAqīdat al-Ṣalaf wa Aṣḥāb al-Ḥadīth, pp. 175–176</div>
  <div class="matn">"I have been fighting Irjāʾ since I began seeking knowledge and until I meet Allāh — ʾInshāʾAllāh. Look at my books and recordings, no lesson passes — and Allāh knows best — except that I fight the Murjiʾah in it. Then they say: 'Rabīʿ is a Murjiʾ!' Liars, they are far worse than the Murjiʾah by hundreds of times, and among them are Rawāfiḍ and Baṭiniyyah; I do not exclude this at all. For whoever has anything of the Sunnah would never dare to commit these crimes: they say to you, 'You insult Allāh! You insult the Messenger! You say: the Messenger conceded his message!' All of this is lies and unparalleled wickedness. We have never seen this in the doctrine of the Khawārij nor in the doctrine of the Rawāfiḍ!"</div>
</div>

## Second Lie: The Accusation of Irjāʾ

They split this slander into two forms: the first group claims he completely removed actions from Īmān; the second claims he viewed actions as perfecting Īmān but not as one of its pillars. Both are blatant falsehoods.

### What the Shaykh Actually Said on Īmān

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Sharḥ ʿAqīdat al-Salaf wa Aṣḥāb al-Ḥadīth, p. 168</div>
  <div class="qt">"Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamāʿah hold that Īmān is speech, action, and belief; it increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience — as the author mentioned: 'Īmān is speech, action, and knowledge.' And knowledge here means belief."</div>
</div>

### Are Actions a Pillar (Rukn) — or Merely a Condition (Sharṭ)?

The Shaykh stated explicitly from his website:

<div class="hadith-block">
  <div class="chain">Shaykh Rabīʿ ibn Hādī al-Madkhalī — official website</div>
  <div class="matn">"'Action is a pillar of Īmān,' because, brothers, as the uṣūl scholars say: 'The condition (sharṭ) is external to the essence; but the pillar (rukn) is part of the essence.' So we say: Īmān is statement, action, and belief, which increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience... So action is a rukn of Īmān and a part of it, not merely a condition; and this is one of the mistakes some scholars fall into."</div>
</div>

### On Abandoning All Actions Entirely

They then claim the Shaykh believed a person could abandon all actions of the limbs and still remain Muslim. The Shaykh refutes this himself:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Kashf Akādhīb wa Taḥrīfāt wa Khiyānāt Fawzī al-Baḥraynī, p. 646</div>
  <div class="qt">"I declare the one who abandons all action entirely to be a disbeliever; but I discourage the use of the term 'جنس' because of the tribulations it causes, as a means of blocking the avenues of evil and corruption."</div>
</div>

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Kashf Akādhīb, p. 764</div>
  <div class="qt">"I have said repeatedly: the one who abandons all action entirely is a disbelieving heretic (kāfir zindīq), but I have prohibited clinging to the term 'genus' because of its vagueness and ambiguity which leads to tribulations. I have clarified that it has no basis in the Book or the Sunnah, nor in the words of the noble Companions."</div>
</div>

### On Whether Īmān Can Decrease to Nothing

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="src">Kashf Akādhīb, p. 647</div>
  <div class="qt">"From the beginning of my scientific life — studying, teaching, and writing — I say, affirm, and declare before Allāh from the depths of my soul: that ʾīmān is speech and action, the speech of the heart and tongue, and the action of the heart and limbs, and that it increases with obedience and decreases with sin. Sometimes I add that it decreases and decreases until only the weight of a particle remains, and sometimes I say: it decreases and decreases — until nothing remains of it."</div>
</div>

<div class="conclusion">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Every single lie leveled against Shaykh Rabīʿ (رحمه الله) crumbles when measured against his own words. He held that actions are a <em>rukn</em> (pillar) of Īmān — not merely a condition. He declared the one who abandons all action to be a kāfir. He explicitly stated Īmān can decrease until nothing remains. He spent his entire life fighting Irjāʾ.</p>
  <p>May Allāh have mercy on this noble Imām, who was attacked by every group that harbored hatred in their hearts toward him because he did not allow them to taint the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ.</p>
